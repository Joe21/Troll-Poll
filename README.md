#BDNS Hosts

This is an app I made as a joke to prank the hosts of my favorite podcast. It allows users to vote for their favorite host and view the results. The catch is that the poll is rigged. Any time a vote is cast for a specific host, the app will also randomly add bonus votes to the other hosts.
